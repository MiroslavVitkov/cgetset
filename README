cgetset - a small utility for automatic setter/getter functions generation.

The program parses a text file of variable declarations. As of now, nearly no grammar is supported 
- no unions, structs, bitfields, let alone classes and other c++ complications.

The use is as follows:
cgetset <input file> <templates folder>

The program searches in the templates folder for fiels with names, matching those of the declared types 
e.g. "int". Then it simply appends the file to the output file. 

If a matching template file is not found, "default" is searched. If that is also not found, the program crashes.

'@' characters, encountered in the template file, are exchanged for the current variable's name.
